This repository contains IPython Notebook with sample code, implementing a binary classifier for the German Credit risk datasets which can be found at https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat857/sites/onlinecourses.science.psu.edu.stat857/files/german_credit.csv


You can view "German_Credit.ipynb" directly on github, or clone the repository, install dependencies listed in the notebook and play with code locally.

### Task

Given the German credit Datasets (german_credit.csv), make an explorative data analysis and build a binary classifier to predict wether or not a new applicant to bank loan can be approved.

### Data (brief description)

The dataset contains a wide range of features such as the Account Balance, Occupation, Sex and Marital Status, etc. all associated with a class (good or bad) indicating the risk of giving the loan to the applicant.
